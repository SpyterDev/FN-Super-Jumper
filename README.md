## THIS PROGRAM NO LONGER WORKS DUE TO FORTNITE PATCHING THE CAR GLITCH

### IMPORTANT NOTE
FN Super Jumper doesn't modify or change any of Fortnite's game files, all it does is just simulate key presses like an autoclicker to trigger the Super Jump car glitch! You shouldn't get banned for using this because it is no different from just using your scroll wheel for the Super Jump glitch. Even though I am 99.999999% sure you won't get banned (I use this program on my main Fornite account), it depends whether Epic wants to ban people using this glitch which is incredibly unlikely (because it is so widespread). In the one in a million chance you get banned, I am not responsible, so use this as your own risk I guess. Also Epic Games will likely patch is glitch sooner or later so enjoy it while you can!

# FN Super Jumper
A tiny program that allows you to power jump higher with cars in FN by using the rapid input glitch. This program gives a power bar and meter, better controls, and controller support for the jump height glitch.

# Setup
FN Super Jumper is incredibly easy to setup. All you have to do is follow these 4 steps:

1. Open your fortnite settings
2. Go to "Keyboard Controls"
3. Go to "Vechicles - Cars"
4. Finally for "Driver Brake" set your alternate (2nd) control to be F1

# Controls
The controls are simple and easy-to-use (for PC at least)

KEYBOARD - Hold down ALT to charge and release

CONTROLLER - Hold down your right D-Pad button to charge and release

# Why are the controls goofy for controller?
Well controllers don't have as much buttons as keyboard so I had to choose a button not used anywhere else or could be avoided. The right D-Pad button fit the bill perfectly, also changing controls on controller isn't as good as keyboard :/

# How it works?
FN Super Jump is pretty basic, it is basically just an auto-clicker you charge (for F1). In the low-rider hydraulics in FN, if there is rapid input, the car registers it as a jump, but if you press it fast multiple times, you are barely off the ground and more velocity is added. If you do this quick enough and enough times you go sky high.
